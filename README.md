# University-project-Rocco

This project is carried out as part of the Wireless Communication module in License 1 at the University
Nice Sophia Antipolis
Rocco is a Bluetooth-controlled boat designed for aquatic exploration. With the ability to navigate straight, turn right, turn left, and stop, Rocco offers a versatile and exciting experience. Originally developed to analyze water quality, Rocco takes its name from one of our team members' beloved dog, adding a touch of fun and adventure to the project.

The code repository for Rocco on GitHub provides all the necessary scripts and configurations to control the boat directly from a smartphone. When a command is sent from the phone, the corresponding relays are activated or deactivated, ensuring smooth and intuitive control. For example, sending the command "F" activates both motors until the next command is received.

Feel free to explore the code, contribute, and join us in unleashing Rocco's potential for discovering new and exciting places on the water!
